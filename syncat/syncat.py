"""A cat-like utility which uses Vim to display files with syntax highlighting.

Syncat runs Vim against an in-memory terminal emulator to render a file using
Vim's syntax highlighting rules, then scrapes the result and outputs it
to its standard output.

The way syncat works is to run vim, feed its output to a full-fledged in-memory
emulated terminal provided by python-pyte, then scrape the state of the
emulated terminal [foreground and background colors in every cell], and finally
output all characters to the user's actual terminal.
